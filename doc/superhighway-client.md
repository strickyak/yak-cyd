# Superhighway Client Specification

## 1. Overview

A **Superhighway client** provides remote read/write filesystem access over HTTP to a Superhighway server. The server exposes its configured `.../fs/` directory as the root `/` of the virtual filesystem.

The protocol is designed to be stateless, human-debuggable, and minimal—requiring no XML, JSON, or multipart framing—so clients can be implemented easily in Go, Python, C, shell scripts, or resource-constrained environments.

## 2. Addressing & URL Path Encoding

### 2.1 Base URL
A client is configured with a server base URL:
```text
http://<host>:<port>
```
(Optionally with a path prefix if reverse-proxied, though typically rooted at `/`.)

### 2.2 Remote Path Normalization & Escaping
- Remote paths are POSIX-style paths starting with `/` (e.g., `/`, `/docs`, `/docs/hello.txt`).
- Path traversal segments (`..`) and NUL bytes (`\x00`) are forbidden and rejected by the server with `400 Bad Request`.
- **Percent-encoding is required on the wire**: Because filenames may contain spaces, `#`, `?`, `%`, and other reserved URL characters (e.g. `Filename might have spaces and #@%$%? funny chars!`), the client **must** RFC 3986 percent-encode path segments when constructing the HTTP request target:
  - In Go: `(&url.URL{Path: remotePath}).EscapedPath()` (or `url.PathEscape(segment)` joined by `/`).
  - Characters like `?` (`%3F`), `#` (`%23`), `%` (`%25`), and space (`%20`) MUST be escaped so they are not interpreted as HTTP query strings or URL fragments.

## 3. Wire Protocol Operations

All requests target `<base_url><escaped_remote_path>`.

### 3.1 `LS` — List Directory or File Metadata
- **Request**:
  ```http
  LS /path/to/target HTTP/1.1
  ```
  *(Aliases accepted by server: `LIST`, or `GET` when the target is a directory.)*
- **Success Response**: `200 OK`, `Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8`
- **Response Body**:
  1. An initial `\n`-terminated line with the non-negative decimal integer count of files and directories that will follow (`<N>`).
  2. `<N>` `\n`-terminated entry lines sorted lexicographically by entry name.
  3. A final `\n`-terminated line containing only a `;` character.
  ```text
  2
  2026-10-31 21:05:09 16 Filename might have spaces and #@%$%? funny chars!
  2026-10-31 21:05:09 4096 docs/
  ;
  ```
  - If the target is an empty directory, `0\n;\n` is returned (distinguishing an empty directory from a crash or empty/truncated HTTP response).
  - If the target is a single regular file, `1\n` followed by the single entry line and `;\n` is returned.

### 3.2 `GET` — Read File Contents
- **Request**:
  ```http
  GET /path/to/file HTTP/1.1
  ```
  *(Optional `Range: bytes=<start>-<end>` header is supported via standard HTTP content serving.)*
- **Success Response**: `200 OK` (or `206 Partial Content`)
  - Headers include `Content-Length` (byte size) and `Last-Modified` (UTC HTTP-date).
  - Response body is the raw, unframed file bytes.
- **Directory Caveat**: Because `GET` on a directory returns its `LS` listing, a client implementing a strict `read_file` operation that wants to reject directories can either check `LS`/`HEAD` first or only call `GET` on known file paths.

### 3.3 `HEAD` — Stat File Headers
- **Request**:
  ```http
  HEAD /path/to/file HTTP/1.1
  ```
- **Success Response**: `200 OK` with `Content-Length` and `Last-Modified` headers and an empty body.

### 3.4 `PUT` — Create or Overwrite File
- **Request**:
  ```http
  PUT /path/to/file HTTP/1.1
  Content-Length: <n>

  <raw file bytes>
  ```
- **Behavior**:
  - Creates the file if it does not exist, or truncates and overwrites it if it does.
  - Parent directory must already exist (otherwise `404 Not Found`).
  - Target must not be an existing directory (otherwise `409 Conflict` or `400 Bad Request`).
- **Success Response**: `201 Created`

### 3.5 `MKDIR` — Create Directory
- **Request**:
  ```http
  MKDIR /path/to/dir HTTP/1.1
  ```
  *(Alias accepted by server: `MKCOL`)*
  - **Recursive Option (`mkdir -p`)**: Append `?p=1` (or `?parents=1`) to create intermediate parent directories automatically and succeed even if the directory already exists:
    ```http
    MKDIR /a/b/c?p=1 HTTP/1.1
    ```
- **Success Response**: `201 Created`
- **Failure**: `409 Conflict` if the directory already exists (when `?p=1` is not set); `404 Not Found` if parent directory does not exist (when `?p=1` is not set).

### 3.6 `RMDIR` — Remove Empty Directory
- **Request**:
  ```http
  RMDIR /path/to/dir HTTP/1.1
  ```
- **Behavior**:
  - Removes the target directory only if it is empty.
  - Fails with `400 Bad Request` if the target is a regular file, is the root `/`, or is not empty.
  - Fails with `404 Not Found` if the target does not exist.
- **Success Response**: `200 OK`

### 3.7 `RM` — Remove Regular File
- **Request**:
  ```http
  RM /path/to/file HTTP/1.1
  ```
  *(Alias accepted by server: `DELETE`)*
- **Behavior**:
  - Removes a non-directory file.
  - Fails with `400 Bad Request` if the target is a directory (clients must use `RMDIR` for directories).
  - Fails with `404 Not Found` if the target does not exist.
- **Success Response**: `200 OK`

### 3.8 `DU` — Recursive Disk Usage
- **Request**:
  ```http
  DU /path HTTP/1.1
  ```
- **Success Response**: `200 OK`, `Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8`
- **Response Body**: A single `\n`-terminated line containing the base-10 sum of all non-directory file sizes (in bytes) rooted at `/path`:
  ```text
  37
  ```

## 4. Parsing Specifications

### 4.1 Parsing `LS` Responses
1. **Framing & Completeness Validation**:
   - Line 1 (initial line) must be a base-10 non-negative integer `<expected_count>`.
   - Exactly `<expected_count>` entry lines must follow before the final `;` line.
   - The final line must be `;` (containing only `;` after stripping `\r\n`).
   - If the response is empty, missing the `;` terminator, or the number of parsed entry lines does not equal `<expected_count>`, the client must treat the response as a failed/partial listing rather than an empty directory.
2. **Entry Line Grammar**:
   Each entry line (with trailing `\n` or `\r\n` stripped) has the grammar:
   ```text
   <YYYY-mm-dd> <HH:MM:SS> <size> <name>[/]
   ```
   - **Split on the first 3 ASCII spaces (`' '`)**:
     - Field 1 (`10` chars): Date in UTC (`YYYY-mm-dd`).
     - Field 2 (`8` chars): Time in UTC (`HH:MM:SS`).
     - Field 3 (`1+` digits): Decimal integer `<size>` in bytes (`int64`).
     - Field 4 (remainder of line): Entry name, with `/` appended if and only if the entry is a directory.
   - **Directory Detection**:
     - Since POSIX filenames cannot contain `/`, a trailing `/` on Field 4 unambiguously indicates `IsDir = true`.
     - Strip the trailing `/` to obtain the clean entry name.
   - **Why splitting on the first 3 spaces is exact**:
     - Even if a filename begins with a space, contains multiple consecutive spaces, or contains arbitrary punctuation (`#@%$%?`), everything after the space following `<size>` belongs verbatim to the filename.

### 4.2 Parsing `DU` Output
- Trim leading/trailing whitespace from the response body and parse as a base-10 `int64`.

## 5. Error Handling

When the server returns a non-`2xx` status code, the response body is a plain-text error message. Clients should map HTTP statuses to filesystem error conditions as follows:

| HTTP Status | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| `200 OK` / `201 Created` | Operation succeeded |
| `400 Bad Request` | Invalid path (`..`), wrong type (`RM` on dir, `RMDIR` on file), or non-empty directory on `RMDIR` |
| `403 Forbidden` | Permission denied by underlying OS filesystem |
| `404 Not Found` | Path (or parent directory) does not exist (`fs.ErrNotExist`) |
| `405 Method Not Allowed` | Unknown HTTP method |
| `409 Conflict` | Target already exists (`fs.ErrExist`) or `PUT` target is a directory |

## 6. Reference Go Client Interface

### 6.1 Library API
```go
package client

import (
	"context"
	"io"
	"net/http"
	"time"
)

type Entry struct {
	Name    string    // Base name without trailing "/"
	Size    int64     // Size in bytes
	ModTime time.Time // UTC modification time (second precision)
	IsDir   bool      // True if line ended with "/"
}

type Client struct {
	BaseURL    string       // e.g. "http://localhost:8080"
	HTTPClient *http.Client // Optional; defaults to http.DefaultClient
}

func New(baseURL string) *Client

func (c *Client) LS(ctx context.Context, remotePath string) ([]Entry, error)
func (c *Client) Get(ctx context.Context, remotePath string) (io.ReadCloser, error)
func (c *Client) Put(ctx context.Context, remotePath string, r io.Reader) error
func (c *Client) RM(ctx context.Context, remotePath string) error
func (c *Client) Mkdir(ctx context.Context, remotePath string, parents bool) error
func (c *Client) Rmdir(ctx context.Context, remotePath string) error
func (c *Client) DU(ctx context.Context, remotePath string) (int64, error)
```

### 6.2 CLI Subcommands (Optional CLI Wrapper)
A command-line client binary (e.g., `shwy --url=http://localhost:8080 <cmd> [args...]`) should support:
- `shwy ls [/path]` — List entries at `/path` (defaults to `/`)
- `shwy get /remote/path [local_path|-]` — Download file (to `local_path` or stdout)
- `shwy put <local_path|-> /remote/path` — Upload file (from `local_path` or stdin)
- `shwy mkdir [-p] /remote/dir` — Create directory
- `shwy rmdir /remote/dir` — Remove empty directory
- `shwy rm /remote/file` — Remove file
- `shwy du [/path]` — Print recursive byte usage of `/path` (defaults to `/`)
